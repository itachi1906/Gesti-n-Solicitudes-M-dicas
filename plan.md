# Medical Request Management System - Project Plan

## Overview
Building a web system for managing medical requests with two user roles:
- **Common User**: Can register, login, submit medical requests via forms, and view their submission history
- **Manager User**: Single admin who receives all requests, manages them, views full history with user details, and exports data to PDF/Excel

---

## Phase 1: Authentication System and User Management ✅
**Goal**: Implement complete login/registration system with role-based access control

### Tasks:
- [x] Create database models for User with roles (common_user, manager)
- [x] Build registration page with role selection (limit manager role to one user)
- [x] Implement login page with email/password authentication
- [x] Add session management and protected routes using LocalStorage
- [x] Create logout functionality
- [x] Build user state management with role checks
- [x] Fix async database configuration (sqlite+aiosqlite)
- [x] Initialize database tables for User and MedicalRequest
- [x] Fix SQLModel query syntax (use select() with proper imports)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All authentication features working correctly

---

## Phase 2: Medical Request Submission System ✅
**Goal**: Enable common users to submit medical requests through comprehensive forms

### Tasks:
- [x] Design medical request data model (patient info, medical details, timestamp, status)
- [x] Create medical request submission form with all required fields
- [x] Implement form validation and file upload support
- [x] Build request submission event handler
- [x] Create success/error feedback for submissions
- [x] Add request status tracking (pending, reviewed, completed)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Form submission system fully operational

---

## Phase 3: Request Management Dashboard
**Goal**: Build manager dashboard for viewing and managing all requests

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create manager dashboard with all requests table
- [ ] Implement request filtering by status, date, user
- [ ] Build detailed request view modal/page
- [ ] Add request status update functionality
- [ ] Show user information for each request

---

## Phase 4: History and Export Features
**Goal**: Implement history viewing and export capabilities

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build common user history page (their own submissions)
- [ ] Create manager full history view (all requests with user details)
- [ ] Implement PDF export for individual requests
- [ ] Add Excel export for full history data
- [ ] Include print functionality for individual requests

---

## Phase 5: UI Polish and Complete Integration
**Goal**: Finalize Material Design UI and ensure all features work together

### Tasks:
- [ ] Apply Material Design 3 principles across all pages
- [ ] Add navigation components (app bar, drawer, bottom nav if needed)
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions
- [ ] Verify role-based access control throughout app
- [ ] Test complete user workflows end-to-end

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features and Final Testing
**Goal**: Complete remaining features and conduct comprehensive testing

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add search functionality in history views
- [ ] Implement notifications for new requests (manager)
- [ ] Create user profile page for editing details
- [ ] Add pagination for large request lists
- [ ] Final UI/UX verification with screenshots
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing of all workflows

---

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Reflex (Python)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Material Design 3 principles
- **Database**: SQLite with aiosqlite (async)
- **Export**: reportlab (PDF), openpyxl (Excel)
- **Authentication**: LocalStorage-based session with bcrypt password hashing

---

## Backend Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

The backend has been successfully initialized and all issues are resolved!

### ✅ Database
- Tables created: `sqlmodeluser`, `medicalrequest`
- Database file: `reflex.db` with async SQLite (aiosqlite)
- Test users created: 1 manager, 1 common user
- Credentials:
  - Manager: manager@test.com / manager123
  - Common User: user@test.com / user123

### ✅ Authentication System
- User registration working (with duplicate manager prevention)
- Login with password hashing (bcrypt) working
- Role-based access control functioning
- Session management with LocalStorage operational
- Invalid credential handling working correctly

### ✅ Medical Request System
- Form validation working correctly (required fields, age validation)
- File upload support configured
- Request submission ready and tested
- Status tracking implemented (pending, reviewed, completed)

### ✅ UI Pages
- Login page rendering correctly
- Registration page with role selection working
- Submit request form with protected route functioning
- Home page with protected content displaying correctly
- All navigation links working

### ✅ Code Quality
- Fixed deprecated SQLAlchemy methods
- Using proper SQLModel select() queries
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Error handling implemented

All core backend functionality is verified and ready for Phase 3 development!
